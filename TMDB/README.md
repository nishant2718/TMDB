# Overview
This is a project to go over TMDB. This project is done programmtically and no third party libraries will be used.

## Additional Features
When scrolling to the bottom, a call is made to fetch more movies and displayed in the list. 

## Architecture
The app follows MVVM-C. In this project, the coordinators are responsible for providing everything the view needs.

The implementation of coordinators (and other architectures) really varies fron company to company based on app needs. This is just my opinion and implementation of coordinators in a standard, small app.

## Future Adjustments
The project was done fairly quickly over a couple days. There's definitely things I can improve, like:
- adding more tests
- add proper logging and remove prints
- add a11y related items
- clean up any UI weirdness or adjust to better cover a given design
